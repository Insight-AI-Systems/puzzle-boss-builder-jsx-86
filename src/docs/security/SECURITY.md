## Authentication Architecture

The authentication system in The Puzzle Boss platform is built using Supabase Auth with the following components:

1. **Authentication Context**: A React context that provides authentication state and functions throughout the application
2. **Protected Routes**: Components that restrict access based on authentication status and user roles
3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Controls what actions users can perform based on their assigned roles
4. **Permission System**: Granular permissions assigned to roles that determine specific capabilities

### Authentication Flow

1. User provides credentials (email/password)
2. Credentials are validated and sent to Supabase Auth
3. On successful authentication, session tokens are stored securely
4. User profile and permissions are loaded
5. User is redirected to appropriate page based on their role

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Data Protection

- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- **Content Security Policy**: Restricts sources of executable scripts
- **Secure Headers**: Implementation of recommended security HTTP headers
- **HTTPS Only**: All communications use HTTPS with HSTS enforcement

### 2. Authentication Security

- **Password Requirements**: Strong password policies enforced
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force attacks by limiting login attempts
- **Session Management**: Secure token storage with automatic refresh
- **CSRF Protection**: Tokens used to prevent cross-site request forgery

### 3. Access Control

- **Role-Based Access**: Users are assigned roles that determine their access level
- **Permission Checks**: Granular permissions restrict access to specific features
- **Protected Routes**: URL routes are protected based on authentication status and roles
- **UI Element Control**: UI elements are conditionally rendered based on permissions

### 4. Audit and Monitoring

- **Security Logging**: Authentication events and security-related actions are logged
- **Failed Attempt Tracking**: Repeated failed attempts trigger account protection measures
- **Session Monitoring**: Active sessions are tracked with device information

## Security Development Guidelines

### Code Guidelines

1. **Always Validate Input**: Never trust user input; always validate and sanitize
2. **Use Prepared Statements**: Avoid string concatenation in database queries
3. **Implement Least Privilege**: Only grant the minimum permissions necessary
4. **Secure Authentication**: Follow authentication best practices consistently
5. **Handle Errors Securely**: Don't leak sensitive information in error messages

### Testing Guidelines

1. **Security Unit Tests**: Write tests specifically targeting security functions
2. **Authentication Flow Tests**: Test complete authentication flows
3. **Penetration Testing**: Regularly conduct penetration testing
4. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Use automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities
5. **Code Reviews**: Conduct security-focused code reviews

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Identified Risks

1. **Authentication Bypass**: Attackers trying to bypass authentication
   - *Mitigation*: Multi-layered auth checks, protected routes, server-side validation

2. **XSS Attacks**: Injection of malicious scripts
   - *Mitigation*: Content Security Policy, input sanitization, output encoding

3. **CSRF Attacks**: Forged requests from authenticated users
   - *Mitigation*: Anti-CSRF tokens, same-site cookies, referrer checking

4. **Session Hijacking**: Stealing user session identifiers
   - *Mitigation*: HTTPS, secure/httpOnly cookies, session regeneration

5. **Data Exposure**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data
   - *Mitigation*: Role-based access control, encryption, data minimization

## Security Incident Response Plan

### Incident Detection

1. Monitor logs for suspicious activity
2. Set up alerts for authentication anomalies
3. Implement user reporting mechanisms

### Incident Response Process

1. **Identification**: Confirm and classify the security incident
2. **Containment**: Limit the damage (e.g., lock accounts, revoke tokens)
3. **Eradication**: Remove the threat and its root cause
4. **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal operation
5. **Lessons Learned**: Document and improve based on the incident

## Regular Security Maintenance

1. Keep dependencies updated with security patches
2. Conduct regular security reviews
3. Stay informed about emerging threats
4. Update security measures as needed
5. Regularly rotate sensitive credentials

## Edge Function Development Style Guide

### 1. Structure and Organization

- **Single Responsibility**: Each edge function should have a clearly defined purpose
- **Modular Design**: Break complex logic into helper functions
- **Consistent Naming**: Use descriptive names following the pattern `action-target` (e.g., `auth-manager`, `rbac-validator`)
- **Error Handling**: Always implement proper error handling and reporting

### 2. Security Best Practices

- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize all incoming data
- **CORS Configuration**: Use appropriate CORS headers based on function purpose
- **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication checks unless function explicitly doesn't require it
- **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting for sensitive operations
- **Logging**: Log all important events, but avoid logging sensitive data

### 3. Performance Optimization

- **Minimize Dependencies**: Keep dependencies to the minimum required
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement appropriate caching where beneficial
- **Response Size**: Minimize response payload size
- **Error Management**: Return appropriate error codes and messages
- **Timeouts**: Implement appropriate timeouts for external calls

### 4. Code Style

- **Comments**: Include JSDoc-style comments for all functions
- **Error Types**: Use consistent error types and messages
- **Response Format**: Standardize on a consistent response format
- **Variables**: Use descriptive variable names and appropriate types
- **Constants**: Extract magic values into named constants

### 5. Testing

- **Test Edge Cases**: Ensure all edge cases are tested
- **Mock External Dependencies**: Use mocks for external services in tests
- **Security Tests**: Include tests for security vulnerabilities
- **Performance Tests**: Test function performance under load

### 6. Example Edge Function Template

```typescript
/**
 * [Function Name] Edge Function
 * 
 * [Brief description of what the function does]
 */
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts";
import { createClient } from "https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2";
import { corsHeaders } from "../_shared/cors.ts";
import { validateRequiredFields } from "../_shared/validation.ts";
import { errorResponse, successResponse } from "../_shared/response.ts";

// Configuration constants
const CONFIG = {
  MAX_ITEMS_PER_REQUEST: 100,
  CACHE_DURATION: 60 * 5 // 5 minutes in seconds
};

serve(async (req) => {
  // Handle CORS preflight requests
  if (req.method === "OPTIONS") {
    return new Response(null, { headers: corsHeaders });
  }

  try {
    // Initialize Supabase client
    const supabaseAdmin = createClient(
      Deno.env.get("SUPABASE_URL") ?? "",
      Deno.env.get("SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY") ?? ""
    );

    // Parse request body
    const { action, ...data } = await req.json();
    
    // Validate required fields
    const { isValid, missingFields } = validateRequiredFields(
      data,
      ['requiredField1', 'requiredField2']
    );
    
    if (!isValid) {
      return errorResponse(
        `Missing required fields: ${missingFields.join(', ')}`,
        "validation_error",
        400
      );
    }
    
    // Process based on action
    switch (action) {
      case 'doSomething':
        // Implementation
        return successResponse({ result: "Success" });
        
      default:
        return errorResponse("Invalid action specified", "invalid_action", 400);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Unexpected error:", error);
    return errorResponse("An unexpected error occurred", "server_error", 500);
  }
});
```
