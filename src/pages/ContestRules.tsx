      <h2>1. General Rules & Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        The Puzzle Boss competitions ("Contests") are skill-based contests where participants compete to solve digital puzzles in the fastest time. By participating in any Contest, you agree to be bound by these Official Rules and the decisions of The Puzzle Boss, which are final and binding in all matters relating to the Contests.
      </p>
      
      <h3>1.1 Eligibility</h3>
      <p>
        Contests are open to individuals who are at least 18 years of age (or the age of majority in their jurisdiction of residence, whichever is older) at the time of entry. Employees of The Puzzle Boss, its parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, and advertising and promotion agencies, and their immediate family members (spouse, parents, siblings, and children) are not eligible to participate.
      </p>
      
      <h3>1.2 Geographical Restrictions</h3>
      <p>
        Contests are void where prohibited by law. Certain prizes may have additional geographical restrictions due to shipping limitations or regulatory requirements. These restrictions will be clearly stated in the specific Contest details.
      </p>
      
      <h2>2. Entry Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        To enter a Contest, you must have a registered account on The Puzzle Boss platform and sufficient credits for the entry fee. Credits can be purchased through your account dashboard or earned through various platform activities.
      </p>
      
      <h3>2.1 Entry Process</h3>
      <p>
        To enter a specific Contest, navigate to the Puzzles section of the platform, select the desired Contest, and click "Enter Contest." The required credit amount will be deducted from your account, and you will be able to start the puzzle immediately or at a later time before the Contest end date.
      </p>
      
      <h3>2.2 Entry Limits</h3>
      <p>
        Unless otherwise specified in the Contest details, participants are limited to one entry per Contest. Multiple accounts created by the same individual to circumvent entry limits are prohibited and may result in disqualification.

      <h2>3. Contest Mechanics</h2>
      <p>
        All Contests are skill-based and require participants to complete digital puzzles. The specific mechanics may vary by Contest type and will be clearly explained before entry.
      </p>
      
      <h3>3.1 Scoring & Winners</h3>
      <p>
        Winners are determined based on completion time, with the fastest valid completion time ranking highest. In the event of a tie, the participant who achieved the completion time first will be ranked higher.
      </p>
      
      <h3>3.2 Valid Completions</h3>
      <p>
        A valid completion requires that the participant correctly assembles all puzzle pieces without assistance from automated tools or third parties. Any evidence of cheating or manipulation will result in disqualification.

      <h2>4. Prizes & Winner Notification</h2>

      <h3>4.2 Verification Process</h3>
      <p>
        Winners must verify their identity by providing government-issued identification that matches their account information. This verification is required to ensure fair play and prevent fraud. Failure to complete verification or providing false information will result in prize forfeiture.
