# Puzzle Boss - Deployment Guide

This document outlines the process for deploying The Puzzle Boss platform to production environments.

## Build Configuration

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables should be configured based on the deployment environment:

| Variable | Development | Production | Description |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------|
| NODE_ENV | development | production | Environment mode |
| VITE_API_URL | http://localhost:8080 | https://api.puzzleboss.com | API endpoint |
| VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS | false | true | Enable analytics tracking |
| VITE_LOG_LEVEL | debug | error | Logging verbosity |

### Build Scripts

Production builds are created using the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Run type checking
npm run typecheck

# Run tests
npm run test

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

### Build Optimizations

The production build includes:

1. **Minification**: All JS, CSS, and HTML is minified
2. **Code Splitting**: Separate chunks for vendor and app code
3. **Tree Shaking**: Unused code is eliminated
4. **Asset Optimization**: Images and other assets are optimized
5. **Source Maps**: Generated but not included in deployment

## Deployment Pipeline

### Continuous Integration

1. Commits to `main` branch trigger CI pipeline
2. Run linting and type checking
3. Execute test suite  
4. Build production artifact
5. Run performance tests on build
6. Deploy to staging environment

### Deployment to Production

1. Create a release tag following semantic versioning
2. CI pipeline builds production artifacts
3. Artifacts are deployed to CDN
4. Database migrations are applied if needed
5. Traffic is gradually shifted to new version

### Rollback Procedure

1. Identify the release tag to roll back to
2. Trigger rollback pipeline
3. Restore previous database state if needed
4. Validate functionality on rollback version
5. Document incident and resolution

## Monitoring Setup

### Error Tracking

- Browser errors are captured and reported to monitoring service
- Errors include:
  - Stack traces
  - User and session information
  - Environment details
  - Reproduction steps when available

### Performance Monitoring

- Core Web Vitals are tracked (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Custom metrics:
  - Puzzle load time
  - Image load performance
  - Game FPS during play
  - User interaction timings

### User Analytics

- Game engagement metrics
  - Time spent in puzzles
  - Puzzles completed
  - Difficulty preferences
- Conversion tracking
  - Registration completion rate
  - Credit purchase funnel
  - Prize claim process

## Version Control Procedures

### Branch Strategy

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: Individual feature branches
- `hotfix/*`: Emergency bug fixes for production

### Release Process

1. Create release branch from `develop`
2. Run full test suite and fix issues
3. Version bump following semantic versioning
4. Merge to `main` via pull request
5. Tag release in git
6. Automated deployment triggered by tag

## Post-Deployment Verification

1. Run smoke tests on critical paths
2. Verify user authentication flows
3. Check payment processing (test transactions)
4. Validate prize claim workflows
5. Monitor error rates for 24 hours post-deployment

## Security Considerations

- All API keys are rotated during major deployments
- Secrets are never stored in code repositories
- SSL/TLS certificates are validated
- Content Security Policy is enforced
- Regular security audits are performed

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check dependency versions
   - Verify node/npm versions
   - Look for environment variable issues

2. **Performance Problems**
   - Check bundle size reports
   - Monitor server response times
   - Review API call patterns

3. **Authentication Issues**
   - Verify API endpoints
   - Check token expiration handling
   - Test social login providers
