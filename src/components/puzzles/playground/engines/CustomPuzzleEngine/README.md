# Custom Lovable Puzzle Engine

## Overview
The Custom Lovable Puzzle Engine is a modular, extensible puzzle component built from scratch for the Puzzle Test Playground. It provides a tile-based puzzle interface with drag-and-drop functionality, guide image toggling, and integration with the existing playground infrastructure.

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **CustomPuzzleEngine**: Main component that orchestrates the puzzle experience
- **PuzzleBoard**: Manages the grid layout and piece placement
- **PuzzleTile**: Individual puzzle pieces with drag-and-drop functionality
- **PuzzleControls**: UI for reset and guide image toggling

### Hooks
- **usePuzzleState**: Manages puzzle state, piece positions, and completion detection
- **usePuzzleConfetti**: Creates celebration effects on puzzle completion
- **usePuzzleTimer**: Tracks time spent solving the puzzle (reused from existing engines)
- **usePuzzleImagePreload**: Handles image loading (reused from existing engines)

## Features
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Intuitive piece movement with visual feedback
- **Guide Image Toggle**: Option to show/hide a faded reference image
- **Completion Detection**: Automatic detection of puzzle completion
- **Confetti Celebration**: Visual celebration effect when the puzzle is completed
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation support and proper ARIA attributes
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Timer Integration**: Tracks and displays solving time
- **Reset Functionality**: Allows starting over with a fresh puzzle
- **First Move Detection**: Timer starts only after the first interaction

## Extensibility
The engine is designed with extensibility in mind:

1. **Modular Architecture**: Each component and hook has a specific responsibility, making it easy to modify or extend.
2. **Puzzle Type Flexibility**: The core logic is built around a generic tile-based system, which can be adapted for different puzzle types (jigsaw, sliding, etc.).
3. **Style Customization**: CSS variables and modular styling allow for easy theming.
4. **Configurable Difficulty**: Support for different grid sizes (rows × columns).

## Integration with Playground
The Custom Lovable Puzzle Engine integrates with the existing Puzzle Test Playground:
- Appears as a selectable option in the engine dropdown
- Uses the same image and difficulty selection controls
- Follows the same layout and styling conventions
- Provides the same timer and completion events

## Future Enhancements
- Additional puzzle types (sliding puzzles, word puzzles)
- More piece shapes (jigsaw-style interlocking pieces)
- Audio feedback for actions
- Save/load puzzle state
- Hint system
- Mobile touch optimization
- Piece rotation mechanics
- Custom image upload support
